Landing Page Project

This project's goal was to build a webpage utilizing newly learned flexbox skills. There are a few sections to the page but it is only an index page. None of the navigation functions as this was just an exercise in a building a single webpage. The page is not scalable to mobile either as the focus was just on getting the page to function on desktops.
